# Mini Browser Games Collection

This repository contains a collection of lightweight, polished browser-based games developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All games feature procedurally generated graphics—no stock images are used. The games are designed to run smoothly in modern web browsers with a dark, neon-inspired aesthetic.



1. Download the HTML file of the game you want to play.
2. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Use the keyboard to interact with the game:

   * **Reflex Tiles**: Use `D`, `F`, `J`, `K` keys to hit tiles. Press `R` to restart.
   * **Neon Dodger**: Use arrow keys (`← ↑ ↓ →`) to move. Press `R` to restart.
4. Enjoy the game!

## Notes

* These games are fully client-side; no internet connection is required.
* Designed for desktop browsers for optimal experience.
* The games are responsive and should scale to most screen sizes.
